# CAB-BOOKING-PORTAL_Sem_2_Project
This Project aims to cut down cost of travelling by using Special Routing Algorithm :Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm.
This project was done as part of my second semester project in PES University for the subject : Problem Solving With C.
The algorithm used helps to find the shortest path from Source to Destination as chosen by the User.
The user details that are required for the booking are encrypted and stored in local device in the form of text file.
The validations are performed for every input provided by the user.
Necessary comments have been added for better understanding.
We have also kept a provision for dynamic fare of the ride (the fare will rise or fall based on the weather conditions...for now we have used a random() for the same).
